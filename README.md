# Penguin-Clusters
Unsupervised Machine Learning

1) Performed data preprocessing including filling missing values, label encoding and standard scalar normalization.

2) Executed K-Means clustering algorithm to divide penguins into different clusters based on provided features in the dataset.
   
3) Developed a K-Neighbors classifier model to predict a penguin's cluster, achieving an accuracy score of 88%.
